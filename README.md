# E-Commerce-Price-Tracker

The Flask application will act as an interface for the user in which the user can register by giving his/her email and password. Registered users can create a bot by entering the product URL and product price. As soon as the price of the given product is equal to or less than the given price, the bot will update the user by sending a mail to the user's registered email.
